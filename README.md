# Azymondias Dotfiles

The dotfiles for my main tower.  All of the instructions are going to be based on arch linux, however most of this should be pretty easy to do on any other distro. This is absolutley a WIP (super early stages) and I am open to suggestions and feedback on how I can make this better.

This is the machine Partpicker for those curious.  I'm still working on getting everything done the way I want but I have big plans for this machine going forward.  https://pcpartpicker.com/user/TheGoldenMagikarp/saved/mBt9NG

## Dependencies

From pacman you can get most of the big ones

```bash
sudo pacman -S feh picom neofetch dunst kitty polybar rofi
```
You will need a few from the AUR using whatever AUR helper you want.  I use yay:

```bash
yay i3-gaps-rounded spotify spicetify system-san-francisco-font-git nerd-fonts-complete
```
